Here's a detailed description of an image classifier using deep learning:

**Introduction**

Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision, where the goal is to assign a label or class to an image based on its visual content. Deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have revolutionized image classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

**Architecture**

A typical image classifier using deep learning consists of:

1. Convolutional Layers: Extract features from images using filters.
2. Pooling Layers: Downsample feature maps to reduce spatial dimensions.
3. Flatten Layer: Flatten feature maps into a 1D vector.
4. Dense Layers: Perform classification using fully connected layers.
5. Output Layer: Produce probabilities for each class.

**Types of Image Classifiers**

1. Binary Classifier: Classifies images into two classes (e.g., cat vs. dog).
2. Multi-Class Classifier: Classifies images into multiple classes (e.g., animals, vehicles, buildings).
3. Multi-Label Classifier: Assigns multiple labels to an image (e.g., image contains both cat and dog).

**Deep Learning Models for Image Classification**

1. LeNet-5
2. AlexNet
3. VGGNet
4. ResNet
5. InceptionNet
6. MobileNet
7. ShuffleNet

**Training Process**

1. Data Collection: Gather labeled images.
2. Data Preprocessing: Normalize, resize, and augment images.
3. Model Definition: Define architecture and hyperparameters.
4. Model Training: Train model using stochastic gradient descent.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate performance on validation set.

**Evaluation Metrics**
